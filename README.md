<h1>ESP32 + SSD1306 + SSD1306, Simple Temperature/Humidity Station With Simple OLED screen!</h1>

<H3>For this example, I'm using integrated SSD1306 with ESP32 and using a separate BME280 sensor to monitor temperature and humidity. It also has pressure and altitude values, but Accuracity of those is unknown!</h3>
<H4>I'm powering it from ESP32's 3v3 pin and ground, and using pin 5 and 4 for SDA, SCL! (it has to be changed in code). it changes screen every 10 seconds, and updates the sensor every 2 seconds.<h4>
<h4>Images of my setup, it may not look the prettiest but it works!</h4>
